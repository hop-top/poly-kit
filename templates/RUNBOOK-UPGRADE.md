# Bring an old project up to date

When new defaults land in poly-kit's tool-versions manifest or
emitters (e.g. bumped Go version, new linter, new managed
service), pull them into an existing project:

## 1. Install (or upgrade) the kit binary

    go install hop.top/kit/cmd/kit@latest

While kit is in pre-release, `@latest` may not resolve. Pin to a
published tag instead, e.g. `go install hop.top/kit/cmd/kit@v0.4.0-alpha.4`
— see <https://github.com/hop-top/poly-kit/releases> for the
current tag.

Or rebuild from source if you're tracking a branch.

## 2. Preview drift

    kit init --check

Exits 0 if your project is in sync. Exits non-zero with a diff
if anything has changed.

## 3. Apply the refresh

    kit init --update

Refreshes `mise.toml`, `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`,
`.devcontainer/docker-compose.yml`, `.env.example`. Only
content INSIDE `# >>> kit-managed >>> … # <<< kit-managed <<<`
markers is touched; user-owned content above markers is
preserved verbatim.

## 4. Sanity-check

    mise install
    mise run install
    docker compose -f .devcontainer/docker-compose.yml config -q

## Copyright years

The scaffold writes copyright years at scaffold time and `kit init
--update` does NOT auto-bump them. This matches the legal convention
that the copyright year reflects when rights attached (creation), not
when the file was last touched — see the [SFLP guide][sflp] and the
[Copyright Office circular][circ].

  - `kit init` (first run) → writes `Copyright (c) <current-year> …`.
  - `kit init --update`    → leaves the copyright lines untouched.
  - `kit init --update --author "<years> <holder>[ <<URL>>]"` →
    overwrites the kit-managed copyright block with the supplied
    holders, e.g. extend `2026` to `2026-2027` by re-running with
    explicit `--author "2026-2027 Acme Inc <https://acme.example>"`.

Multiple holders: repeat `--author` and/or pass `;`-delimited values
within one invocation. Order is preserved.

User-added Copyright lines below the
`# <<< kit-managed: copyright <<<` close marker survive `--update`.

## Adding or removing services

    kit init --add-service redis
    # … or in compose YAML directly for full control

Catalog: `postgres`, `redis`, `minio`, `mailpit`, `redpanda`.
Each service bind-mounts its data into `.data/<service>/` at the
project root (gitignored).
